Getting started
===============

In this section, we will see **how to configure and start** on `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`__ .

We will take a look of all the :doc:`configurations<configuration>` available, then give all the commands and code templates
to help you start the application.

.. note::
   Other configurations like in Kubernetes are possible, we only show a few of them currently.

   :doc:`You can contribute<../contribute/contribute>` to improve this documentation and add more ways to start Iris.
